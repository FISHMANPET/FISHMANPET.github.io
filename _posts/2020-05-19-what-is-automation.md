I'm the team lead of our new Infrastructure Automation team, a team that exists basically because I asked for it. I've been given an incredible amount of freedom to  to set my own vision and direction for the team. Importantly, it means "Automation" gets to mean whatever I say it means.

But, what do _I_ think Automation is?

I've been an ops my entire career, and as an elder millennial I think I'm just old enough to be able to say "back in my day."
And back in my day, we didn't have virtualization, or most of the configuration management tools as we know them now.
Building and configuring new systems and applications was comparatively rare, and was often done by hand.
I'm now thinking back fondly of how the Computer Science department where I worked as a student during undergrad used rdist to distribute configuration files to hundreds (maybe thousands) of Unix systems.

We did things by hand, that's manual.
Lot's of IT people all over are in a state like this.
A new employee is hired, and they have to create an AD account, add the user to some mailing lists, enable access to some cloud services, and maybe a few other things.
Some of them will get frustrated by all this manual effort, which also happens to be error prone, and they'll start writing a script to do the work for them.
This is the first step towards automation, but it's really not quite automation.

As cliched as dictionary definitions are, the word automation is derived from the word automatic.
But a tech having a script that can be used when a new employee is hired isn't automatic. it still requires the tech to take an action.
IT seems rife with farming analogies these days, so I think back to farming 150 years ago, before tractors.
It was lots of hard manual labor, and the tractor revolutionized that.
But the tractor didn't automate farming, it _mechanized_ it.

Likewise, the person working the help desk and writing a script to make their job easier hasn't fully automated that task, but they have mechanized it.
I don't make this distinction because I think mechanization is less important than automation. In fact it's vitally important, if for no other reason it's the first step to automation.
